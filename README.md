<!-- ### DESIGN IDEAS
- on home page maybe change link to 'Jump to projects/experience' or 
'Jump to my work
-alternate color schemes between pages (i.e. white background, then
on next page do the opposite and have navy background, etc).)
- also have projects/work experience in the same section (same page/background) but 
different headings like
WORK heading
and then squares with my work
PROJECTS heading
and then scroll to see projects
- i can also make an activites and leadership section too


### TODO
- make responsive for XL screen https://speckyboy.com/designing-websites-for-large-screens/
- test above by zooming out to 50% view -->
